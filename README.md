# equipment_data
A back-end web server in C# combined with a React front-end to render equipment data.

Load up server in visual studio and run.
`cd client`
`npm start`

Doesn't cater for CORS _yet_ so an extension like [Allow Cross Origin Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) could be used.
