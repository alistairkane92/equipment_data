# Equipment Data
An MVC web server in C# with a React front-end to render equipment data.

Doesn't cater for CORS errors _yet_ so an extension like [Allow Cross Origin Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) could be used.

Load up `server` in Visual Studio and run.

Navigate to folder, `cd client` then: 

`npm i` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start the client.
