# Equipment Data
An MVC web server in C# with a React front-end to render equipment data.

Load up server in visual studio and run.
`cd client`
`npm start`

Doesn't cater for CORS errors _yet_ so an extension like [Allow Cross Origin Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) could be used.
